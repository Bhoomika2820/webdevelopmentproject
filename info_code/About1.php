				</a>
				<p><b>Founder’s Talk:</b> While I have always been excited about all innovations in technology as a young computer engineer, some things bothered me. My primary concern is the ever increasing gap between industry standards and curriculum.
					Companies spend a huge amount to train students who then are of value to them. While our education system provides reasonable knowledge in all the aspects of computation, we still lack in their Application. CodeX is, therefore, an
					initiative to taper the gap in knowledge required by our industries and that promulgated to the students at SFIT. We, at SFIT, engage students with new technologies, coding strategies, and industry standards, so we together can contribute
					towards the realization of India's Dream in Technological Advancement.</p>

					<h1 class="committee_head ">EESA</h1>
				</a>
				<p>
					The prime motto of the Electrical Engineering department is to provide quality education through the student-centered teaching methodology. The students are given a strong foundation in Electrical Engineering along with the problem-solving techniques
					which will be helpful in clearing competitive exams like GATE, which is a qualified test for government jobs. The department encourages our students to develop new project ideas, which would be useful in the day to day life. They are
					also encouraged to undergo winter/summer internship in companies related to electrical stream. While the faculty members train the students to excel in various fields with the help of all modern teaching methods and advanced laboratory
					facilities, the Electrical Engineering Students Association (EESA) organizes various Competitions, Seminars, Industrial Visits, and guest lectures for the students. The primary focus of EESA is to add more fun and value to the already
					high-quality teachings provided by the faculty members by organizing such events. This helps bridge the gap between academics and industry as well as inculcate a sense of responsibility and develop qualities like competitiveness and
					initiative amongst them.
